### Log Base 2 ( binary logarithm ): log₂(x)
```
Log base 2, also known as the binary logarithm. Is the logarithm to the base 2. The binary logarithm of x is the power to which the 
number 2 must be raised to obtain the value x.
For example, the binary logarithm of 1 is 0, the binary logarithm of 2 is 1 and the binary logarithm of 4 is 2. It is often used in
computer science and information theory.

### Natural Log Calculator( natural logarithm ) : ln(x) or logₑx or log(x) [if the base of e is implicit (ঊহ্য)]
```
The natural logarithm is the logarithm to the base e (Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.718281828).
```
### Log Base 10 Calculator( common logarithm ) : lg(x) or log₁₀x
```
The common logarithm of x is the power to which the number 10 must be raised to obtain the value x. For example, the common logarithm
of 10 is 1, the common logarithm of 100 is 2 and the common  logarithm of 1000 is 3.

### Log (Logarithm) Calculator :  logₐ(x)
```
logₐ(x) = y
=> aʸ = x
=> a^logₐ(x) = x [y = logₐ(x)]

If you want to compute a number's natural logarithm, you need to choose a base that is approximately equal to 2.718281.
y = logₑx = ln(x)
=> x = eʸ = exp(y)
```
### Logarithm with Arbitrary base
```
logₐ(x) = ln(x) / ln(a)
logₐ(x) = lg(x) / lg(a)
```
```
Rule or special case	Formula
Product	: ln(x * y) = ln(x) + ln(y)
Quotient : ln(x/y) = ln(x) − ln(y)
Log of power : ln(xy) = y * ln(x)
Log of e : ln(e) = 1
Log of one : ln(1)=0
Log reciprocal : ln(1/x) = −ln(x)
