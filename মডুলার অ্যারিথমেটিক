# Log Base 2 : log₂(x)
Log base 2, also known as the binary logarithm. Is the logarithm to the base 2. The binary logarithm of x is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to obtain the value x.
For example, the binary logarithm of **1 is 0**, the binary logarithm of <b>2 is 1</b> and the binary logarithm of **4 is 2**. It is often used in computer science and information 
theory.
