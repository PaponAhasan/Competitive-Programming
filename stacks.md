# Stacks
```
Stacks are dynamic data structures. Which follows the Last In First Out (LIFO). The last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted from it.

Features of stacks : 

* Dynamic data structures
* Do not have a fixed size
* Do not consume a fixed amount of memory
* Size of stack changes with each push() and pop() operation. Each push() and pop() operation increases and decreases the size of the stack by 1.

Elements can be inserted or deleted only from one end of the stack i.e. from the top(). The element at the top is called the top() element. The operations of inserting and 
deleting elements are called push() and pop(). When the top element of a stack is deleted, if the stack remains non-empty.
```
```
There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

* Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
* Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
* IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
* IsFull: Check if the stack is full
* Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it

### Working of Stack Data Structure
```
The operations work as follows:

* A pointer called TOP is used to keep track of the top element in the stack.
* When initializing the stack, we set its value to -1 so that we can check if the stack is empty by comparing TOP == -1.
* On pushing an element, we increase the value of TOP and place the new element in the position pointed to by TOP.
* On popping an element, we return the element pointed to by TOP and reduce its value.
* Before pushing, we check if the stack is already full
* Before popping, we check if the stack is already empty

```c++
push( x ): Insert element x at the top of a stack

void push (int stack[ ] , int x , int n) {
 if ( top == n-1 ) {         //If the top position is the last of position in a stack, this means that the stack is full
    cout << “Stack is full.Overflow condition!” ;
    }
    else{
        top = top +1 ;            //Incrementing top position 
        stack[ top ] = x ;       //Inserting element on incremented position  
    }
}
```
```c++
pop( ): Removes an element from the top of a stack

void pop (int stack[ ] ,int n ) {
   if( isEmpty ( ) ){
      cout << “Stack is empty. Underflow condition! ” << endl ;
   }
   else{
      top = top - 1 ; //Decrementing top’s position will detach last element from stack            
    }
}
```
```c++
topElement ( ): Access the top element of a stack

 int topElement ( ){
    return stack[ top ];
 }
``` 
```c++
 isEmpty ( ) : Check whether a stack is empty

bool isEmpty ( ){
   if ( top == -1 )  //Stack is empty
      return true ; 
   else
      return false;
}
```
```c++
size ( ): Determines the current size of a stack

int size ( ){
   return top + 1;
}
```

### Stack Time Complexity
```
For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e. O(1)
```
### The most common uses of a stack
```
* To reverse a word - Put all the letters in a stack and pop them out. Because of the LIFO order of stack, you will get the letters in reverse order.
* In compilers - Compilers use the stack to calculate the value of expressions like 2 + 4 / 5 * (7 - 9) by converting the expression to prefix or postfix form.
* In browsers - The back button in a browser saves all the URLs you have visited previously in a stack. Each time you visit a new page, it is added on top of the stack. When you press the back button, the current URL is removed from the stack, and the previous URL is accessed.
```
### Stack in C++ STL
```
Stack uses an encapsulated object of either vector or deque (by default) or list (sequential container class).

The functions associated with stack are: 
* empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1) 
* size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
* top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
* push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
* pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
```
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    stack<int> stack;
    stack.push(21);
    stack.push(22);
    stack.push(24);
    stack.push(25);
    stack.emplace(1);
	
    stack.pop();
    stack.pop();
    
    cout<<stack.size()<<"\n";
    
    while (!stack.empty()) {
	cout << ' ' << stack.top();
	stack.pop();
    }
    
    stack<int> stack1,stack2;
    stack1.swap(stack2);
}
```
### Problem 01: Balanced Parentheses
```
You have a bracket sequence made up of opening '(' and closing ')' parentheses. You must check if this bracket sequence is balanced.

### Problem 02: Balanced Brackets
```
Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“, “}”, “(“, “)”, “[“, “]” are correct in exp.

Example: 

Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” 
Output: Balanced

Input: exp = “[(])” 
Output: Not Balanced
