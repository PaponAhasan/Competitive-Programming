### Binary/ N-ary Trees
```
A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child,
and the topmost node in the tree is called the root.
```
```
where each node has the following 3 components:

1. Data element: Stores any kind of data in the node
2. Left pointer: Points to the tree on the left side of node
3. Right pointer: Points to the tree on the right side of the node

If a tree is empty, it is represented by a null pointer.
```

```
Root: Top node in a tree
Child: Nodes that are next to each other and connected downwards
Parent: Converse notion of child
Siblings: Nodes with the same parent
Descendant: Node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child
Ancestor: Node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
Leaf: Node with no children
Internal node: Node with at least one child
External node: Node with no children
```
