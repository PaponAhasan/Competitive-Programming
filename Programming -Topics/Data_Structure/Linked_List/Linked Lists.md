Linked lists are one of the most fundamental data structures. It is a chain of nodes with each node having data and a pointer to
the next node. The head pointer points to the first node and the last element of the list points to NULL. Lists can be emptytoo. 
In that case, the head points to NULL.

A linked list is a way to store a collection of elements. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

```
A node is a collection of two sub-elements or parts. A data part that stores the element and a next part that stores the link to 
the next node.
